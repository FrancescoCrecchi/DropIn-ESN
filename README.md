# DropIn-ESN

This repository contains the code used to produce the results presented in the **IJCNN 2017** paper **"DropIn: Making (Reservoir Computing) Neural Networks Robust to Missing Inputs by Dropout"** by Bacciu, Crecchi (University of Pisa) and Morelli (Biobeats LTD).

The paper presents a novel, principled approach to train recurrent neural networks from the Reservoir Computing family that are robust to missing part of the input features at prediction time exploiting Dropout regularization technique to simulate missing inputs during training.

This software is not inteded to be a library for this kind of computations but we think it could useful to reproduce the experiments shown in the paper and as a starting point for further developments.
